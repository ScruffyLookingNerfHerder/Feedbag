# Feedbag

## About This App

Feedbag is a react based food searching app. At present, it searches for recipes and restaurants from 2 different API's and returns them to the user based on search queries, and allows users
to create and edit a grocery list. In future updates, Feedbag will allow users to favorite a restaurant or a recipe. It will then allow users to edit the recipes to their own specifications, based on
their experimentation while creating those recipes. Additionally, Feedbag will allow users to make their own private notes on their favorites restaurants, so they can remember their favorite dishes or maybe that they had bad service, without alerting everyone and their mother to this face through an online review should they not want to do that.
